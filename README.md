# Type Error in TypeScript Function
This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and how to fix it.

## The Bug
The `greeter` function is defined to accept a string argument and return a string. However, the code attempts to pass an array of strings to the function, resulting in a type error.

## The Solution
The solution involves checking the type of the input argument or modifying the function signature to accept an array of strings. The provided solution demonstrates the latter approach.
